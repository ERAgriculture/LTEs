# LTEs
Long Term Experiments in ERA

Welcome to the repository for the Long-Term Experiments in ERA (Evidence for Resilient Agriculture) project. This repository is designed to create a comprehensive Bookdown document that provides detailed insights into long-term experiments (LTEs) in the ERA dataset.

# About This Repository
This repository includes:

- Methods and Data Processing: Documentation of the methodology used to acquire and process LTE data, along with details on data sources and download instructions.
- Data: All datasets used in the scripts to generate the Bookdown document are included for transparency and reproducibility.
- Package installation : Specific Script to install the ERAg Package
- Systematic Map: A detailed exploration and visualization of LTEs, highlighting key findings and trends.
- Interactive Features: A Shiny app integrated into the document, enabling users to explore climate data interactively for selected locations and crops.
# How to Use This Repository
- Run the Script: Execute the R scripts included in the repository to process the data and generate outputs.
- Generate the Bookdown Document: Use Bookdown to create a full HTML document that integrates the systematic map, methods, data, and interactive Shiny app.

# Explore the Document: The final HTML document includes:
- Methods for acquiring and processing LTE data.
- Systematic visualizations of LTE trends.
- A Shiny app to explore climate and yield data interactively.

# Highlights
- Interactive Systematic Map: Visualizes LTE data trends, durations, and practices.
- Shiny App Integration: Allows users to interactively explore climate data for specific locations and crops, including abnormal years and crop-specific requirements.
- Comprehensive Documentation: Includes details on the methods and processes, making the project transparent and reproducible.
# Requirements
To run the scripts and generate the document, ensure you have:

- R (4.2 or newer)
- Required R packages: shiny, bookdown, ggplot2, dplyr, and others listed in the script.
